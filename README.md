## Overview

This project explores the **necessity and effect of skip-connections in U-Net architectures** under varying task complexities in medical image segmentation. The study examines how the usefulness of skip-connections depends on the **textural similarity** between foreground and background, using:

- Controlled **synthetic texture experiments**
- Evaluations on real **medical imaging modalities**: Ultrasound (US), CT, and MRI
- Comparison across three U-Net variants:
  - **Standard U-Net**
  - **NoSkip U-Net** (no skip-connections)
  - **AGU-Net** (Attention-Gated U-Net)

---

## Key Contributions

- **Novel robustness evaluation pipeline** using texture-based task complexity via LBP histograms
- Evidence that **skip-connections may reduce robustness** in out-of-domain (OOD) scenarios
- Finding that **attention-gated skips** help only under high-complexity conditions
- Demonstrated **failure modes** of skip-connections where performance gains come at the cost of generalizability

## Architecture Variants

| Model        | Description                              |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| `U-Net`      | Standard U-Net with identity skip-connections |
| `NoSkipU-Net`| U-Net with all skip-connections removed  |
| `AGU-Net`    | U-Net with attention gating on skips     |

Implemented using [MONAI](https://monai.io/) and PyTorch.
